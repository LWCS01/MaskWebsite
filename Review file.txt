Interesting content:

The content is very informative and highlights the importance of wearing face masks in order to prevent the transmission of covid 19.
There is a range of pictures and videos which keep the content varied.

Consistency and quality of visual presentation:

Both page are consistent as they use the same background and font etc. In some areas, the odd word was hard to read as it clashed with the 
background slightly, but this wasn't really an issue.

Quality of written presentation:

On the whole, the quality was very good and it was easy to read. However, there were a few spelling mistakes which I have made comments on, but I'm sure these were just typos.

Validity of HTML:

The HTML all seems to be valid code with appropiate start and end points to each paragraph and heading etc.

Evidence of collaboration:

I can see that there is more than one user that has contributed to this project, and they have left comments on each others code to highlight anything that needs improving.
There appears to be a balanced contribution between the users.

Improvements:

You could perhaps change the background in order to make some of the writing slightly more readable, and correct the spelling mistakes. Besides that, it is a very good website that gets your desired point across 
with the use of varied content.
